You cannot use these in commercial works without my permission, awight? And by commercial I mean *anything* that you charge moneys for in any capacity or charge for access to. I'll be most upset if you do so.

All it takes is a mail :)

I'm putting these out there because one more graphics set on the internet never hurt anyone, right?

All sounds (bar the speech) were created with SFXR. http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html

Give the man some love, it's an awesome, awesome package.

If you're interested in porting SY!NSO! itself to another format. Mail me, let's talk. I doubt I'll object unless you're some sort of evil conman in which case, I'll say no - eff off.

In case you didn't know, all sound and graphics are from Squid Yes! Not So Octopus! a rather fine arena shooter by me, Robert Fearon. It's available from www.bagfullofwrong.co.uk. Try it, it's fun.
